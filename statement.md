# 📌 Project Statement – Programming Quiz Game

The *Programming Quiz Game* is a Python-based interactive console application designed to test users on basic programming concepts through multiple-choice questions. The program randomly selects ten questions from a predefined question bank and prompts the user to answer using choices A, B, C, or D.

A scoring mechanism is implemented where:

* *+10 points* are awarded for a correct answer
* *–3 points* are deducted for an incorrect answer
* *+9 bonus points* are added at the end of the quiz

Once the quiz concludes, the user enters their name, and their final score is stored in a persistent leaderboard file named *scores.txt*. The program reads, sorts, and displays the leaderboard in descending order, allowing users to compare results across multiple game sessions.

This project demonstrates core Python concepts, including:

* Conditional statements
* Loops
* Random sampling
* File handling (read/write operations)
* Score calculation and ranking
* Basic user input handling

The project structure is simple, modular, and beginner-friendly. It can be easily extended by adding more questions, difficulty levels, or even a graphical user interface (GUI).
